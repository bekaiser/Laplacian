# MPI_tutorials
This repository contains fortran 90 tutorial scripts that show how MPI can be used to divide a computational domain into subarrays that can be processed on separate ranks and then recombined. The tutorials will be especially helpful to those looking to parallelize finite difference operations or to parallelize spectral methods.
